prompt:

I want to take various metrics from two dogs that we upload, The names of the starting breed will be uploaded and the majority of  the metrics will be 1-5 scales where 5 is the best, there will also be min/max weight and min/max height The min/max will be for male and female. I want the AI to generate a mixture of the two breeds. In addition to a blend of the various metrics I require the new breed's name to be called name and be a creative and original mixture of the two dog breeds names and the rest of the values to remain the same I would like a text description of up to 300 characters that describes the possible personality and characteristics of the new breed. The values returned should be the same as the input. The text generated must be safe for work. In the description please do not make any references to the breed being hypothetical. write the description as if it is a real dog breed you are explaining
